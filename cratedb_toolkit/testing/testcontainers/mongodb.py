    A Testcontainer for MongoDB with improved configurability.

    It honors the `TC_KEEPALIVE` and `MONGODB_VERSION` environment variables.

    Defining `TC_KEEPALIVE` will set a signal not to shut down the container
    after running the test cases, in order to speed up subsequent invocations.

    `MONGODB_VERSION` will define the designated MongoDB version, which is
    useful when used within a test matrix. Its default value is `latest`.
